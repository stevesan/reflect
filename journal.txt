PLAYTEST: 
- fix character walking up slope problem
	ok actually just caused by in-air acceleration
	potential solution: Only allow in-air accel if there is vertical speed? hmm
	--> or just check for left/right walls and disallow in-air acceleration into walls of a certain normal? 
- clearer visual feedback about reflection - what sort of animation?
- ok new level geo pipeline: Use blender to build geometry, then just use Unity to place objects
- level-select screen. Just show the level geometry and detect clicks on level areas! add number overlays
- still draw outline of polygon
- add per-level tutorial/story text
- SERIOUSLY consider grid-snapping (and angles) to keep things less fidgety..
	- although the visual grid bg helps already

ART:
- make "ghost trail" effect for main character

STORY/LYRICS:

----------------------------------------
Idea 1: "Philosophical"

Life is simple when my goals are clear (star)
Even when they seem impossible (star)
But sometimes, things become uncertain (? block)
And I need to do some self-reflection (mirror)
Should I seek money? (coin)
Should I seek love? (heart)
Should I seek status? (ribbon)
Should I seek approval? (thumbs up)
Or just be myself? (self)
But am I who I want to be? (white self)
Can I improve myself? (taller self)
Or should I just accept my faults? (self)
What is worth suffering for? (crown of thorns)
What is worth years of my life? (sand timer)
When should I just give up? (surrender flag)
Am I thinking too much? (brain)

----------------------------------------
Idea 2: "Nightmare"
largely mimicking the Mulholland Dr. diner scene

So, I have this recurring dream...
I'm always in a box of some sort
And, for some reason, I'm always trying to get this stone
It starts out pretty simple at first
Then I realize that I can change things
It's hard to describe, but I'm able to alter my situation
It's pretty exhilirating. I feel powerful. In control.
And I'm able to keep chasing the rocks
Sometimes things get tricky, but I find a way
Random things appear here and there. Like most dreams.
