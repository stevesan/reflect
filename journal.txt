PLAYTEST: 
- triangulation!
almost there, but our monotone decomp isn't correct.
Need to implement this:
http://research.engineering.wustl.edu/~pless/546/lectures/l7.html
http://groups.csail.mit.edu/graphics/classes/6.838/F01/lectures/PolygonTriangulation/monotone2.html
clearer, although for vertical sweep: http://groups.csail.mit.edu/graphics/classes/6.838/F01/lectures/PolygonTriangulation/monotone1.html

keep a list of edges with associated "helper" verts.
edges sorted in vertical order, linked list?
	LinkedList.AddAfter( Node, Node )
need to look up edges quickly, and also find the lowest edge over a given vertex

TODO: think about when edge is vertical...i think if we just use the defs from here we'll be OK:
http://groups.csail.mit.edu/graphics/classes/6.838/F01/lectures/PolygonTriangulation/monotone2.html
reg, start, end, merge, split

when you might insert a verticle edge:
reg - P,C,N, edge CN may be upwards. but this is OK, since vert N will be the next event, and it'll eventually end at some non-vert line. we can actually just not add it!
start - 
end
merge
split
actually, yes, any time you have an upward edge, its end will be the next event, removing it.
downward edge?
reg - not possible
start - not possible
end - doesn't insert edges
merge - doesn't add
split - not possible
So, conclusion is: if we detect an upward one, just ignore it! downwards will never get inserted
}

- fix character walking up slope problem
	ok actually just caused by in-air acceleration
	potential solution: Only allow in-air accel if there is vertical speed? hmm
	or just check for left/right walls and disallow acceleration into walls of a certain normal? 
- make line of reflection extend the whole screen

- add per-level tutorial/story text

- SERIOUSLY consider grid-snapping (and angles) to keep things less fidgety..
	- although the grid bg helps already

ART:
- make "ghost trail" effect for main character

STORY/LYRICS:

----------------------------------------
Idea 1: "Philosophical"

Life is simple when my goals are clear (star)
Even when they seem impossible (star)
But sometimes, things become uncertain (? block)
And I need to do some self-reflection (mirror)
Should I seek money? (coin)
Should I seek love? (heart)
Should I seek status? (ribbon)
Should I seek approval? (thumbs up)
Or just be myself? (self)
But am I who I want to be? (white self)
Can I improve myself? (taller self)
Or should I just accept my faults? (self)
What is worth suffering for? (crown of thorns)
What is worth years of my life? (sand timer)
When should I just give up? (surrender flag)
Am I thinking too much? (brain)

----------------------------------------
Idea 2: "Nightmare"
largely mimicking the Mulholland Dr. diner scene

So, I have this recurring dream...
I'm always in a box of some sort
And, for some reason, I'm always trying to get this stone
It starts out pretty simple at first
Then I realize that I can change things
It's hard to describe, but I'm able to alter my situation
It's pretty exhilirating. I feel powerful. In control.
And I'm able to keep chasing the rocks
Sometimes things get tricky, but I find a way
Random things appear here and there. Like most dreams.
